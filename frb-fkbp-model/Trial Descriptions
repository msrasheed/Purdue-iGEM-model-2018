Trial Descriptions

Trial 1 
	- made sure all params between 0 and 2 (prior)
	- accelerated matlab model for faster simulation
	Results
	-not good
		- distribution for parameters everywhere

Trial 2
	- made initial parameter values for all walkers start at true values
	Results
	- walkers didn't vary much. 
	- parameter distributions were centered on actual values

Trial 3 
	- walkers all start initially at real values
	- changed posterior probability function to be the natural log of the probability
	Results
	- walkers didn't vary still
	-stayed on initial values

Trial 4
	- saved this trial after many other runs
	- changed proposal scale parameter to 2e-15 and number of runs to 10,000
	Results
	- simulations run faster when proposal scale is smaller, i don't know why (probably because parameter values aren't changing, see next points)
	- walkers don't change their values at all. Stick with what ever random value they were assigned to initially
	Solutions?
	-UMMMMM, idk. Prob do some research on proper prior distributions

Trial 5
	- took natural lograthm of parameters. Am only looking for two dissociation constants now
	- implemented prior from previous study
	Results
	- results still all over the place, but moving in order of magnitude i want
	Solutions
	- my standard deviation for the error is way too high, is giving the go ahead for many parameters 

Trial 6
	- turns out SSE wasn't calculating correctly so fixed it
	- fixed some other bugs
	Results
	- actually got a good looking prior distribution, but not at correct values
	Solutions
	- decrease standard deviation for errorGaussian?

Trial 7
	- tested with 4 parameters again
	Results
	- got good looking posterior distributions, but not at correct values
	Solutions
	- will try to limit standard deviation

Trial 8 
	- tested with 4 parameters
	- tested against different data sets that started with varying amounts of rapamycin
	Results
	- the posterior distribution, i've noticed, is almost the same as the prior if not exactly the same
	- realized errorGaussian was to blame, was either approving everything or nothing
	- can't really fix cause results from different parameters have too close of an SSE to actual
	- will probably have to give up on this option

Trial 9
	-realized prior was wrong; x axis was log of K_d values, not the power at which they were at
	Results
	-strong correlation to where prior is at buy walkers tend to wander very far and very negative if allowed to
