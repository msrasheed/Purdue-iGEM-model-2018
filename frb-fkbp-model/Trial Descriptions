Trial Descriptions

Trial 1 
	- made sure all params between 0 and 2 (prior)
	- accelerated matlab model for faster simulation
	Results
	-not good
		- distribution for parameters everywhere

Trial 2
	- made initial parameter values for all walkers start at true values
	Results
	- walkers didn't vary much. 
	- parameter distributions were centered on actual values

Trial 3 
	- walkers all start initially at real values
	- changed posterior probability function to be the natural log of the probability
	Results
	- walkers didn't vary still
	-stayed on initial values

Trial 4
	- saved this trial after many other runs
	- changed proposal scale parameter to 2e-15 and number of runs to 10,000
	Results
	- simulations run faster when proposal scale is smaller, i don't know why (probably because parameter values aren't changing, see next points)
	- walkers don't change their values at all. Stick with what ever random value they were assigned to initially
	Solutions?
	-UMMMMM, idk. Prob do some research on proper prior distributions
